Welcome! I am a second-year Economics PhD student at the University of Southern California (USC)

My research interests span development economics, growth, and economic history. I am interested in studying firms, technological adoption, and knowledge diffusion within the political and institutional structures in low-income country settings.

You can access a copy of my CV [here](/files/pdf/arujshukla-cv.pdf).
